### Hi, I'm Catkommander
I'm 16 and I like coding.
I also like video games and music.
Currently, there is not much to say about me, except that I am not a professional developer.
I've one Repository, which is set to private. (I think, I'll make it public, as soon as I add a README.md)
I'm new to GitHub and git in general.
I'm leaning the programming-language Java, and my code is probably bad.
