# Hi, I'm Catkommander
## About me
I'm 19 and I like coding.
I also like video games and music.<br>
Currently, there is not much to say about me, except that I am **not** a professional developer.<br>
I still make mistakes (Everyone does, right?)
## About my GitHub experience
I've got some Repositories, which are set to private.
I'm new to GitHub and git in general.
## About my skills
I'd say I'm pretty good with Java.<br>
I've learned a bit of HTML/CSS/Javascript for a small project of mine.
I also started learning C++, but I'm taking it rather slow.
### The thing I'm most proud of?
Definetly my very own implementation of a HTTP-Server in Java.<br>
While it was quite a challenge to implement most of the HTTP-Protocol, I was able to expand my coding knowledge.
#### PS:
I usually forget to update this readme, so you can expect this info to be outdated sometimes...
