# Hi, I'm Catkommander
## About me
I'm 16 and I like coding.
I also like video games and music.<br>
Currently, there is not much to say about me, except that I am **not** a professional developer.<br>
I still make mistakes (Everyone does, right?)
## About my GitHub experience
I've got two Repository, which are set to private. (I think I'll make one of them public, as soon as I'm finished writing the base code)<br>
I'm new to GitHub and git in general.
## About my skills
I'm learning the programming-language Java, and my code is probably not the best.<br>
My next topic I want to learn are streams from java.util.stream. <br>
Another thing I want to learn next is the whole network stuff (Websockets, etc.)
