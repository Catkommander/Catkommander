# Hi, I'm Catkommander
## About me
I'm 16 and I like coding.
I also like video games and music.
Currently, there is not much to say about me, except that I am **not** a professional developer.
I still make mistakes (Everyone does, right?)
## About my GitHub experience
I've one Repository, which is set to private. (I think I'll make it public, as soon as I add a README.md)
I'm new to GitHub and git in general.
## About my skills
I'm leaning the programming-language Java, and my code is probably not the best.
My next topic I want to learn are streams from java.util.stream. 
Another thing I want to learn next is the whole network stuff (Websockets, Running a Website (in theory), etc.)
