# Hi, I'm Catkommander
## About me
I'm 17 and I like coding.
I also like video games and music.<br>
Currently, there is not much to say about me, except that I am **not** a professional developer.<br>
I still make mistakes (Everyone does, right?)
## About my GitHub experience
I've got some Repositories, which are set to private. (There is a slight chance of making them public)<br>
I'm new to GitHub and git in general.
## About my skills
I'm learning the programming-language Java.<br>
I also started learning C++, but I'm taking it rather slow.
### The thing I'm most proud of?
Definetly my very own implementation of a HTTP-Server in Java.<br>
While it was quite a challenge to implement most of the HTTP-Protocol, I was able to expand my coding knowledge.
## My current Project?
A Discord Bot!<br>
It has the feature of generating a timetable for anyone on the server.<br>
It also uses said Server in order to make the creation of the timetable way easier.<br>
More features are also planned! I hope I get to implement them while I'm still at school or else all the work might be redundant.
