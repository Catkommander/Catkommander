# Hi, I'm Catkommander
## About me
I'm 18 and I like coding.
I also like video games and music.<br>
Currently, there is not much to say about me, except that I am **not** a professional developer.<br>
I still make mistakes (Everyone does, right?)
## About my GitHub experience
I've got some Repositories, which are set to private. (There is a slight chance of making them public)<br>
I'm new to GitHub and git in general.
## About my skills
I'm learning the programming-language Java.<br>
I also started learning C++, but I'm taking it rather slow.
### The thing I'm most proud of?
Definetly my very own implementation of a HTTP-Server in Java.<br>
While it was quite a challenge to implement most of the HTTP-Protocol, I was able to expand my coding knowledge.
